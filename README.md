# Caltrans-Conveyal-Post-Processing-Tool
An R Shiny app to process Conveyal .tiff outputs and generate accessibility metrics/maps.
Notes:
- In order to view maps, a weight .TIFF must be uploaded, even though this parameter is labeled as optional. If a weight .TIFF isn't uploaded, the user will receive a red error message on the maps tab. This is an error that will be fixed.
